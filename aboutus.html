                Direct Donate is a non-charity organization founded by Aleena, Clauria and Rahel. These three came together to 
                find a way to improve donate and present a human to human connection between those who donate and those who recieve donations.
                This page is centered around helping indiviuals whose lives have been affected by a natural disaster one way or the other. 
                It allows people to share their stories of tragedy and people to listen to this stories and decide to give to them and support them.<br>

                The founders of this app wished to remove the idea of donating to a charity and not knowing where your money is going, so it allows people
                to directly donate to the people they want and even keep in contact with them if they want to.
